# Spock Test Runner for VS Code

A VS Code extension that provides comprehensive test support for the Spock testing framework in Java projects. This extension integrates with VS Code's Test API to provide seamless test discovery, execution, and debugging capabilities for Spock tests.

**Author**: Lukas Zaruba

> **Inspiration**: This extension was inspired by [Daniel Micah's spock-test-runner](https://github.com/donnffd/spock-test-runner) but focuses exclusively on VS Code's Test API integration rather than CodeLens functionality.

## Features

- **Test Discovery**: Automatically discovers Spock test classes and methods in your workspace
- **Test Execution**: Run individual tests, test classes, or all tests through VS Code's Test Explorer
- **Debug Support**: Debug Spock tests with full breakpoint support and variable inspection
- **Build Tool Support**: Works with both Gradle and Maven projects
- **Real-time Updates**: Automatically updates test tree when files change
- **Error Reporting**: Detailed error messages with file locations for failed tests
- **Output Streaming**: Real-time test output in VS Code's Test Results panel

## Requirements

- VS Code 1.85.0 or higher
- Java 11 or higher
- Gradle or Maven build tool
- Spock framework in your project

## Installation

### From VS Code Marketplace (Coming Soon)
1. Open VS Code
2. Go to Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X)
3. Search for "spock-test-runner-vscode"
4. Click Install

### From Source
1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm run compile` to build the extension
4. Press F5 to run the extension in a new Extension Development Host window

## Usage

### Test Discovery
The extension automatically discovers Spock tests in your workspace. Tests are organized in the Test Explorer panel under the following hierarchy:
- Workspace
  - File (.groovy files)
    - Test Class (classes extending Specification)
      - Test Methods (feature methods)

### Running Tests
You can run tests in several ways:
1. **Run All Tests**: Click the play button in the Test Explorer
2. **Run Specific Test**: Click the play button next to a specific test
3. **Run from Command Palette**: Use `Ctrl+Shift+P` and search for "spock-test-runner-vscode" commands
4. **Run from Context Menu**: Right-click on a test file and select "Run Spock Test"

### Debugging Tests
1. **Debug All Tests**: Click the debug button in the Test Explorer
2. **Debug Specific Test**: Click the debug button next to a specific test
3. **Set Breakpoints**: Click in the gutter next to line numbers in your test files
4. **Debug from Command Palette**: Use `Ctrl+Shift+P` and search for "spock-test-runner-vscode" commands

### Supported Test Patterns
The extension recognizes the following Spock test patterns:

```groovy
class MySpec extends Specification {
    
    def "should do something"() {
        given:
        // setup
        
        when:
        // action
        
        then:
        // verification
    }
    
    def "another test"() {
        expect:
        // simple assertion
    }
}
```

## Configuration

### Build Tool Detection
The extension automatically detects your build tool:
- **Gradle**: Looks for `build.gradle` file
- **Maven**: Looks for `pom.xml` file

### Debug Configuration
The extension automatically creates debug configurations for your project. You can find them in `.vscode/launch.json`:

```json
{
    "type": "java",
    "name": "Debug Spock Tests (Groovy)",
    "request": "attach",
    "hostName": "localhost",
    "port": 5005,
    "projectName": "your-project-name",
    "sourcePaths": [
        "${workspaceFolder}",
        "${workspaceFolder}/src/test/groovy",
        "${workspaceFolder}/src/main/groovy"
    ]
}
```

## Sample Project

A sample Gradle project with Spock tests is included in the `sample-project` directory. This project demonstrates:
- Basic arithmetic operations testing
- User service testing with CRUD operations
- Error handling and exception testing
- Multiple test scenarios

To test the extension:
1. Open the `sample-project` folder in VS Code
2. Install the Spock Test Runner extension
3. Open the Test Explorer to see discovered tests
4. Run or debug the tests

## Troubleshooting

### Tests Not Discovered
- Ensure your test classes extend `Specification`
- Check that your build tool (Gradle/Maven) is properly configured
- Verify that Spock dependencies are included in your project
- Check the Output panel for "Spock Test Runner" logs

### Debug Not Working
- Ensure Java Extension Pack is installed
- Check that debug port 5005 is available
- Verify that your project has proper source paths configured
- Check the Output panel for debug-related error messages

### Build Tool Issues
- Ensure `gradlew` or `gradle` command is available in your PATH
- For Maven, ensure `mvn` command is available in your PATH
- Check that your build files are valid

## Development

### Building from Source
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile TypeScript
npm run compile

# Watch for changes
npm run watch

# Run tests
npm test
```
